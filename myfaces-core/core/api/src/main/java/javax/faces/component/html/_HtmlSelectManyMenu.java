/**
 * Allow the user to select zero or more items from a set of available
 * options. This is presented as a drop-down "combo-box" which allows
 * multiple rows in the list to be selected simultaneously.
 * <p>
 * The set of available options is defined by adding child
 * f:selectItem or f:selectItems components to this component.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Renders as an HTML select element, with the choices made up of
 * child f:selectItem or f:selectItems elements. The multiple
 * attribute is set and the size attribute is set to 1.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The value attribute must be a value-binding expression to a
 * property of type List, Object array or primitive array. That
 * "collection" is expected to contain objects of the same type as
 * SelectItem.getValue() returns for the child SelectItem objects.
 * On rendering, any child whose value is in the list will be
 * selected initially. During the update phase, the property is set
 * to contain a "collection" of values for those child SelectItem
 * objects that are currently selected.
