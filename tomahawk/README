Exigen modified version of Apache MyFaces Tomahawk 1.1.11

Changed:
 - calendar icons to match EIS style
 - SimpleDateFormatter to use Calendar instead of deprecated java.util.Date methods to get date values
 - calendar JavaScript and styles to prevent corruption of year selection control after AJAX refresh
 - SimpleDateFormatter to use Calendar wrong day and month input, because when was type on month more than 12, 
   then year was increase by one and if type on day more than month have it, then month increase by one
