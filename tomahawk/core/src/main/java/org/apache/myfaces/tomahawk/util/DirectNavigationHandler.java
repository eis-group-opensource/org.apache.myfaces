/**
 * An alternative implementation of the standard JSF NavigationHandler API which
 * directly using the outcome of an action as the name of the page to navigate to.
 * <p>
 * This bypasses the "logical navigation" approach of standard JSF, so that pages
 * can be wired together by using actual urls in command actions and action-method
 * return values.
 * <p>
 * When this navigation-handler is configured, all navigation-rule entries in
 * faces-config.xml files are ignored completely.
 * <p>
 * This navigation handler does not work well in combination with other custom
 * navigation handlers, as it never passes any calls down to underlying
 * implementations. Having another NavigationHandler decorate this one will
 * work; having this navigation handler decorate another will not as the
 * decorated handler will never be invoked. Therefore if multiple navigation
 * handlers are to be used (eg the Tomahawk RedirectTrackerNavigationHandler
 * in combination with this one), then this should be listed first in the
 * faces-config.xml file so that the other handlers decorate this one.
