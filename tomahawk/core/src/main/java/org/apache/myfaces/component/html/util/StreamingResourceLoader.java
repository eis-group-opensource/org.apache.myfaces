/**
 * Serve component-specific resources that MUST be embedded in the HEAD
 * of an html page.
 * <p>
 * Currently, there is only one case where resources <i>must</i> be in the
 * document head: inline CSS or links to CSS stylesheets.
 * <p>
 * When using the StreamingAddResource class, a single link is output in the
 * document HEAD for each page which embeds the name of this class in the url.
 * This causes the browser to make a GET request to that link url when rendering
 * the page; the tomahawk extensions filter sees the embedded ResourceLoader
 * class name and creates an instance of this class to handle the request.
 * <p>
 * Note that for other resources the StreamingAddResources class generates urls
 * that embed the standard MyFacesResourceLoader url, ie this class does not
 * handle serving of resources other than the ones that MUST be in the head 
 * section.
 * <p>
 * The url also embeds a "request id" which is unique for each page served. This
 * id is then used as a key into a global-scoped cache. The data there was inserted
 * during the previous request, and is deleted as soon as it is served up by this 
 * class.
